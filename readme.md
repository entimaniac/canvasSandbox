# Canvas Sandbox
This is a basic project I set up to experiment with canvas with barebones html, css, and javascript. 

## Motivation
Sometimes I feel like I'm relying on the magic of react and its comprehensive tools and libraries and sometimes I just want to make sure I know I can throw together a website with the basics. 

## Demo
A hosted demo of this project can be found here: https://entimaniac.github.io/canvasSandbox/
